# CKEditor Spotify Plugin

Plugin for adding a [Spotify Embed](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/guides/adding-a-spotify-embed/) to the CKEditor.

Supports both Spotify URIs (spotify:album:1DFixLWuPkv3KT3TnV35m3) and Spotify URLs ([http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6](http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6)).

Requires `CKEditor 4.3+` with the `widget` plugin . The editor instance must allow `div` and `iframe` tags.

The plugin uses a few custom styles. These are automatically included in the [classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/classic.html) instance, but must be copied for [inline editors](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/inline.html) and for the final target webpage. To include the custom styles into your editor/webpage, include the following in the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="<PATH_TO_CKEDITOR>/plugins/spotify/styles/spotify.css"
  />
</head>
```

Published in the official [CKEditor plugin repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/spotify).
